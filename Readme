This code is cross-platform and should compile under Linux ,MacOS and Window$ OS.

**************************************************************************
Dependencies:
VTK (version >5) www.vtk.org
CMAKE www.cmake.org
**************************************************************************

Simple compilation HowTo under Linux:

- extract the archive and launch a terminal under the extracted directory
- type "cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_MULTITHREADING=true"
- then "make"

the executables (ACVD, ACVDQ and AnisotropicRemeshingQ should be found under the "bin" subdirectory)

*Note for window$ users : if you get this compilation error :
fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file '..\bin\Debug\vtkSurface.lib'
you can fix it by unselecting 'build_shared_libs' with the cmake UI

*************************************************************************
execute ACVD.exe and ACVDQ.exe without arguments to see the available options.
(respectively ACVD and ACVDQ for linux)

the output of the program is written in the file simplification.ply

additionnally, when running ACVD, a file output_1.ply is also written. It is the output mesh before post-processing using quadrics.

note that to enforce a manifold output mesh, such as explained in [3], you need to use the -m 1 option, and to define a correct number of spare clusters using options -sf or -sc.
